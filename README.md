# Advantage_Garage_Project
This is the code for the mini garage project for advantage FSE. It simulates a very symplified garage system.



The program runs with the user's input, who gets to decide most of the variables in the simulation and the events that take place.

More specifically, besides the default values the system has for quick runs, the user can specify the garage's prices about each vehicle type and how many parking spaces it has. The user can also add more employees to the 'database' and more cutomers, both of which he can fully customise.

It's important to note that the project in order to keep it at a syplified version, has a lot of limitations. For example there is max amount of money you can charge per hour depending on the vehicle and there is a max amount of parking spaces the garage can have. In addition, each customer can have only up to two vehicles.

The program is very strict over the user's input, meaning it only accepts values that correspon to its tasks and it has restrictions on string inputs (e.g. names can't have numbers in them).
